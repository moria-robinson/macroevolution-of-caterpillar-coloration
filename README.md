# macroevolution-of-caterpillar-coloration
A macroevolutionary exploration of the relationships between protective coloration and ecology in 1808 species of North American Lepidoptera.

-data-
Original data (trait data; phylogenetic tree; list of aPriori hypotheses) will be made available on Figshare

-bootstraps-wrangled.zip-
Contains data bootstraps used in this manuscript. As bootstrapping process is random, re-running bootstraps (scripts 1.1 and 1.2, below) will generate different permutations of the data. This is a set of 1000 bootstraps used in downstream analyses.

-code-
1.1 - generate 1000 bootstrapped datasets; run models on each associating pattern and color
1.2 - generate 1000 bootstrapped datasets; run models on each associating diet ecology, pattern and color
2.0 - collate all bootstrap outputs (bootstrapped data; statistical outputs)
3.0 - summarize statistics across bootstraps; penalize for significance; generate results tables
4.0 - generates tree figure (Fig 3) (two trees: radial, and vertical with traits mapped into tips. Tree figure was customized in photoshop


-figures-
Contains folder of clips used in tree figure; data bootstrap used for tree trait data; and PDF of tree
