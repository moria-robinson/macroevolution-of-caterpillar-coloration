# macroevolution-of-caterpillar-coloration
A macroevolutionary exploration of the relationships between protective coloration and ecology in 1808 species of North American Lepidoptera.

Data (original dataset + bootstraps used in reported analyses); phylogenetic tree; list of aPriori hypotheses; large figure files will be made available on Figshare

-code-
1.1 - generate 1000 bootstrapped datasets; run models on each associating pattern and color
1.2 - generate 1000 bootstrapped datasets; run models on each associating diet ecology, pattern and color
2.0 - collate all bootstrap outputs (bootstrapped data; statistical outputs)
3.0 - summarize statistics across bootstraps; penalize for significance; generate results tables
4.0 - generates tree figure (Fig 3) (two trees: radial, and vertical with traits mapped into tips. Tree figure was customized in photoshop; colors of clades, etc.)
